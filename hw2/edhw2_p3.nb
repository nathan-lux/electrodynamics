Homework 2 Part 3
This problem is focused on finding the self capacitance of prolate and oblate spheroids.
Quite frankly, I do not know how to find the self capacitance of an oblate spheroid or a prolate spheroid
I was however able to find a compendium 
In[1]:= Plot[e/ArcSin[e],{e,-1,1}]
Out[1]= 
In[3]:= Plot[e/Log[(1+e)/Sqrt[1-e^2]],{e,-1,1}]
Out[3]=
